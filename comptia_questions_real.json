        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Comprehensive and Detailed Explanation From Exact Extract: The scenario involves an application that should retrieve data from a local database server but is failing to do so. This likely indicates a problem in communication between the application and the database server (such as a network issue, port misconfiguration, or service unavailability). The correct troubleshooting approach involves testing the network/service connectivity between the client and the database. Let\u2019s examine the options: A. ipconfig:This command displays IP configuration details for Windows systems, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. While useful for diagnosing general network issues, it does not test service connectivity or the availability of a specific application port/service. B. nslookup:Used to query DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses. However, since the question references a local server (likely accessed via IP or static hostname), DNS is probably not involved. Also, it does not test application/service availability. C. netstat:Displays active TCP connections, listening ports, and routing tables. It helps determine whether the local system is listening for or maintaining any network connections, but it does not initiate a connection to test availability. It\u2019s diagnostic but not interactive for service testing. D. curl:This is the most appropriate tool for this scenario. curl is used to test connectivity to services over protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. If the application retrieves data via a web interface or API (common in database-driven applications), curl can be used to test if the application can successfully reach and retrieve data from the server. It provides immediate, testable feedback on whether the server and service are available and responsive. Example usage: curlhttp://localhost:8080/api/data This command would test whether a local server's application programming interface (API) is available and responding on port 8080.

        "explanation": "Comprehensive and Detailed Explanation From Exact Extract: The correct answer isVNC (Virtual Network Computing). VNC is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It is platform- independent and widely supported on Linux, which makes it ideal for providinginteractive remote support for a Linux-based operating system. It allows the technician not only to view the remote desktop session but also tocontrol it, fulfilling the need to see and interact with the user\u2019s session. A. VPN(Virtual Private Network) creates a secure tunnel to a network but doesnot provide desktop sharing or session controlby itself. C. SSH(Secure Shell) provides secure command-line access to Unix/Linux systems but does not offergraphical desktop interaction, which is a requirement in this case. D. RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) is primarily a Microsoft protocol, and although it can be made to work on Linux, it isnot natively supported on legacy Linux systems, and thusless suitablethan VNC in this scenario. CompTIA A+ 220-1102 Core 2 Objective Reference: Objective 1.8 \u2013 Given a scenario, use features and tools of the operating system.
